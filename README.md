These Hammerspoon scripts are designed to enhance the usability and productivity of macOS by providing various workspace management features. The scripts currently help display time near the mouse cursor, prevent the menu bar from appearing, automatically tile windows of whitelisted applications, and open URLs in different browsers.

### 🖥️🐙 FrameMaster
`FrameMaster.lua` - Take control of your Mac's 'hot corners', menu bar, and dock. Master your screen frame and manage your workflow with minimal distractions.

#### Features
- Hot corners: Define custom actions for each corner of the screen. Actions are defined in the hotCorners table and can be updated as needed.
- Keep the dock and menubar hidden.
- Reopen last app: When an app is killed, a modal will be shown to allow you to easily reopen it.

#### How to Use
- Start the script and try moving your mouse to the corners of the screen to see the actions and tooltips.
- Use the Shift key to change the action performed in a corner.

### 🌐🔀 HyperlinkHijacker
`HyperlinkHijacker.lua` - It's your link, and you decide where it goes. 

#### How to Use
- When you click a link, a list will pop up with your defined browsers/profiles. If no choice is made before the countdown ends, the first browser in the list will automatically open the link. To bypass the chooser and directly open the link in the first browser, press the Shift key while clicking the link.
- A handy feature is the ability to copy a link directly to your clipboard by choosing the "Copy to Clipboard" option in the chooser.
- Passthroughs are rules that allow specific links to bypass the browser and open directly in their respective applications. You can define them in the passthroughs variable. For example:
```lua
local passthroughs = {
    spotify = { url = "https://open.spotify.com/", appName = "Spotify", bundleID = "com.spotify.client" },
    -- Add more passthroughs here if needed
}
```
- Setting up Browsers: Specify your preferred browsers in the browsers variable along with any necessary arguments. For example:
```lua
local browsers = {
    { name = "Arc", appName = "Arc", bundleID = "company.thebrowser.Browser", args = {""} },
    { name = "Google Chrome", appName = "Google Chrome", bundleID = "com.google.Chrome", args = {""} },
    -- Add more options here if needed
}
```
